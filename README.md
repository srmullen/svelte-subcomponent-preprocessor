Svelte Nested Component Plugin
==============================

Should write blog post on how to use the svelte preprocess api.


- Svelte preprocess api tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Mg93aRJeI4

- Probably need to write the component code to disk. Maybe write it inside node_modules like vite does.

TODO
----

- Configurable out directory.
- Documentation
- Tests
- Make sure it works with sveltekit.
- Make sure it works with typescript.
- Use it with css-vars plugin
